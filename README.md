A1 Sauce Team's Programming Assignment 1

Description:
In this assignment, we implement Neural Networks & Logistic Regression to train using both linear and non-linear data. Then, we plot the respective models' decision boundaries. Doing this, we can observe the limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of both classifiers. Additionally, we also train both classifiers using a dataset consisting of images of decimal digits to classify a test set of images. Our models performed quite well with an accuracy of ~93.5% (logistic regression) and ~92.5% (neural network with one hidden layer).

Our branches consist of our individual work (reports, respective tests, etc), whereas master will contain plots & working/submitted code.
